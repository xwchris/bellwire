# Changelog

All notable changes to Bellwire are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for public repository releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Present Bellwire Pro as an adaptive large purchase sheet with a clearer
  Private-free / Hosted-Pro explanation and localized StoreKit pricing.
- Add a black-box Direct v2 conformance test for signed requests, endpoint
  coverage, replay protection, stale timestamps, unknown keys, and tampering.

### Fixed

- Show Pro content immediately while StoreKit products load instead of leaving
  the paywall visually empty on slow App Store connections.
- Keep the newest verified Apple entitlement across multiple transaction
  chains, avoid duplicate background purchase analytics, and make atomic
  monthly usage increments unambiguous in PostgreSQL.
- Reject oversized authenticated test Event and Private wake request bodies.
