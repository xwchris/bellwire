# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `401 UNAUTHORIZED` on management route | `BELLWIRE_AGENT_TOKEN` prefix and binding age | Generate a new iOS binding code and bind again |
| `401 INVALID_TOKEN` on event ingest | Runtime secret and project ownership | Create a new project-scoped Ingest Token and update the platform secret |
| `422 EVENT_SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND` | Event `type` and active schema | Create the schema or correct the dotted event name |
| `422 SCHEMA_VALIDATION_FAILED` | Error `details` array | Fix required types and remove fields not declared in the schema |
| `200 deduplicated: true` unexpectedly | `Idempotency-Key` construction | Use the stable business/run ID, but include event kind when two events share one ID |
| Event exists, no Delivery row | Registered device, project pause, Surface enabled | Open the iOS app, enable notifications, and check project state |
| `retryable:QueueUnavailable` | Cloudflare Queue quota and binding health | Restore Queue capacity, then resend the same idempotency key to retry dispatch safely |
| `BadDeviceToken` or `Unregistered` | APNs environment and app reinstall | Reopen the app to register the new device token; match sandbox/production |
| Delivery `failed` with provider-token error | APNs Key ID, Team ID, private key | Repair Worker secrets without placing them in the repository |
| Test works, production does not | Actual deployment secret scope | Inspect the target environment rather than the local shell |
| Provider webhook returns `401` | Raw-body preservation, signing secret, timestamp tolerance | Verify the unmodified body with the secret for that exact endpoint and environment |
| Provider retries a successful webhook | Response timing and durable handoff | Return `2xx` after Bellwire accepts/deduplicates it, or after a durable queue accepts it |
| Revenue or counts drift | Duplicate, reordered, or replayed provider events | Recompute the absolute value from the source of truth and overwrite the stable Surface |

For diagnosis, preserve the Event ID, error code, and timestamps. Do not paste raw sensitive payloads into logs or chat.
