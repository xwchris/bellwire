# Bellwire API

Default base URL: `https://api.bellwire.app`

Management routes require `Authorization: Bearer $BELLWIRE_AGENT_TOKEN`.
Private runtime wakes use a project-scoped `bw_wake_...` token. Hosted Event
and Surface writes use the narrower project-scoped `bw_live_...` token.

Real event ingestion:

```http
POST /v1/events/{projectId}
Authorization: Bearer bw_live_...
Content-Type: application/json
Idempotency-Key: payment-ord_123
```

Status semantics:

- `201`: a new event was accepted.
- `200` with `deduplicated: true`: that project/idempotency key already exists.
- `accepted_by_apns`: APNs accepted the request; device presentation is not confirmed.
- `422`: schema missing or payload validation failed.
- `429`: short-term rate limit or monthly Signal quota exceeded.

Private wake:

```http
POST /v1/projects/{projectId}/private-wakes
Authorization: Bearer bw_wake_...
Content-Type: application/json
Idempotency-Key: source-operation-stable-key

{"reference":"22-or-more-url-safe-random-characters","priority":"normal"}
```

The body is limited to 512 bytes and unknown fields are rejected. This route
must never receive notification title, body, project identity, Logo URL,
service hostname, or Event data. A `MONTHLY_SIGNAL_LIMIT_REACHED` response is
terminal until its `resetAt`; clients must not loop.

Live Surface writes are idempotent by `(projectId, surfaceKey)`. Reusing the
same key updates the existing Surface and increments `version` only when the
rendered payload changes. Routine writes preserve `displayOrder`; list APIs sort
by `displayOrder` and then stable ID, so content refreshes never move cards.

Application runtimes should write live Surfaces with their project-scoped
`BELLWIRE_INGEST_TOKEN`, not a management Agent token:

```http
PUT /v1/projects/{projectId}/surfaces/revenue-today
Authorization: Bearer bw_live_...
Content-Type: application/json
```

Projects accept an optional `logoUrl` on create or update. It must be a public
HTTPS URL up to 2048 characters. Send `{"logoUrl": null}` to remove it. The
iOS app uses it for project avatars, and APNs marks notifications as mutable so
the Notification Service Extension can add the image as a rich attachment.
